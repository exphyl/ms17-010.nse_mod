# smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse 
# A modified version of the smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse to work with lua 5.2 and nmap 6.4

I was frustrated with the current released version not working with lower versions of Lua and Nmap so I made a few edits to get it to work. I apologize if the added code is terrible. This was my first time playing with Lua and I'm not really a programmer. Use it at your own risk and the usual be good not bad blah blah blah that comes along with great power and responsibility and Tonka trucks. 

Just don't be a dick.
