# All that stuff that should go on the top
Name: smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse 
Desc: A modified version of the smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse to work with lua 5.2 and nmap 6.4 
Source: https://github.com/cldrn/nmap-nse-scripts/blob/master/scripts/smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse

# Why This Exists:
I was frustrated with the current released version not working with lower versions of Lua and Nmap so I made a few edits to get it to work. I apologize if the added code is terrible. This was my first time playing with Lua and I'm not really a programmer. It should work with Lua 5.1 but I make no promises. 

# Standard Legalese: 
Use it at your own risk and the usual be good not bad blah blah blah that comes along with great power and responsibility and Tonka trucks. 

# Also:
Don't be a dick. Someone worked hard to create the original version, if you modify this version, make sure you give them credit for all the work they did.
