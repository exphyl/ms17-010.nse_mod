# ms17-010.nse_mod
A modified version of the smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse to work with lau 5.2 and nmap 6.4


I was frustrated with the version out there not working with lower versions of Lau and Nmap...
I found this script here: https://github.com/cldrn/nmap-nse-scripts/blob/master/scripts/smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse
Just don't be a dick.
